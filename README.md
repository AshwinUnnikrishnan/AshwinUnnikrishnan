About:


I'm an experienced Machine Learning Engineer focusing on Data Science, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. I'm currently furthering my education by pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University in Boston.
My professional journey includes experience with leading companies like Qualcomm and Raysecur Inc. During my tenure at Qualcomm, where I was part of the IoT stability test team, I had the opportunity to contribute to several Machine Learning projects. These experiences ignited my interest in Artificial Intelligence and ultimately led me to pursue a Master's degree in the same.
At Raysecur, a pioneer in the development of dedicated mail security scanners recognized as a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology (QATT) under the U.S. SAFETY Act, I was involved in the development of pioneering models for the detection of contrabands in terahertz images.

Throughout my career, I've honed my skills in data analysis, including data preprocessing, and have built and managed end-to-end pipelines for a variety of applications such as sentiment analysis, object detection, segmentation, face recognition, GANs, and more.

<br>
In my free time, you'll often spot me at the local bouldering gyms, challenging myself to solve intricate rock problems. I have a strong passion for budget backpacking and am currently developing a project to enhance the travel experience for all.=

I'm as open to making new connections as a freshly opened bag of potato chips!
